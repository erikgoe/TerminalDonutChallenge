# TerminalDonut challenge
Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9npZVpiMI

## The challenge
How long does it take for you to write a terminal program from scratch, which renders the same (or a similar) donut as above? No stackoverflow, no libraries (except terminal IO and trigonometric functions), no other sources. No preparation time. I did not read Andy's blog post before i started, just watched Joma's video. It's only allowed to look up elementary things (like how to clear the terminal window). Use any programming language you want. That said, let's start!

## How to run
    g++ terminalDonut.cpp -o terminalDonut
    ./terminalDonut
